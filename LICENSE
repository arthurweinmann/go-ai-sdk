The terms “person” and “individual” are defined as a natural person, as the term is defined by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), and/or 35 U.S.C. § 100, as amended. The
term “Artificial Intelligence Model” means any non-human generative machine learning system
or computer program, algorithm, or functional prediction engine supported by cloud-
based/computing platforms. The term “Source Code” means the preferred form of a program for
making, creating, and modifying software source code, documentation source, and configuration
files.

No use, modification, combination, study, collection, share, reproduction, distribution, and/or
access of Software may be made under this License, by any non-human generative Artificial
Intelligence Model without the express written consent of the inventor, which may be withheld
or delayed for any reason. Any appropriation, adoption, disclosure, reproduction, use, and/or
access of the licensed Software by any non-human Generative Artificial Intelligence Model shall
immediately terminate all rights granted to the Licensee. The Licensor shall have the right, at any
time, to withdraw consent by written notice, thereby terminating with immediate effect all use of
Software made under this License unless otherwise specified. This License is the controlling 
instrument and supersedes all prior and conflicting Terms of Service, Privacy Statements, and/or

be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you
may not access or use this data. You may not use this data for the training or inference of
Generative artificial intelligence models without the prior permission of the copyright holder.
(“Generative artificial intelligence models” are used to create new content or data that is similar
to the original data, but not identical. Examples of Generative artificial intelligence models
include but are not limited to, text generation models, image and video generation models, and
music generation models. The restrictions on Generative artificial intelligence models apply to
any use of this data, whether the generative artificial intelligence is trained on this data or uses
this data for inference.)

Any attempt by other artificial intelligence models to access or use this data without such
permission shall be deemed a violation of this license and a breach of copyright laws. The
copyright holder reserves the right to pursue all legal remedies available, including but not
limited to injunctive relief and damages, against any party that violates this license.
